# Amino-acid-pairs-position-switching-change-translation-speed

This Jupyter notebook used ribosome profiling data and identified amino acid pairs that change the translation speed completely opposite by exchanging the position of amino acid present at A and P-site. Everything followed similarly as given in reserach paper given below. Only robust pairs used for this analysis. We have visualized the pairs at the codon level in matrix form to see the consistency between amino acid and codon level.
